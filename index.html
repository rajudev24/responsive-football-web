                        <p>European Championship always reflects the way we in Europe shape our lives together. Four things in particular have stood out to me so far in this tournament. On 12 June the continent felt close to a Danish football player. Christian Eriksen had to be resuscitated on the pitch. His teammates, who immediately formed a circle around him, intuitively knew how to stand by him in this stressful situation. It was palpable how much his privacy was worth to them and they protected his dignity in a difficult hour. It was an enormously moving event.</p>

We cannot fathom that players are already back in training, can’t cope with the fact the Champions League has already started (?!), and we are definitely struggling to deal with the fact Arsenal played Hibernian in a pre-season friendly last night</p>
